This Java project uses Maven for building and managing dependencies. It includes a structured skeleton code in src/main/java, unit tests to complete in src/test/java, and uneditable LMS tests in za/co/wethinkcode/lms/tests. Use IntelliJ or Maven commands to build, test (mvn test), and run (mvn compile exec:java) the application.
